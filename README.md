LinkedIn / GitHub Project Description
ðŸš€ Multi-Tool AI Chatbot using LangGraph, LangChain, and Streamlit

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest AI project â€” a Multi-Tool Chatbot built using LangGraph and LangChain, integrated with Streamlit for an interactive user experience!

ðŸ”§ Key Features:

Multi-Tool Integration: Uses tools like Arxiv, Wikipedia, and Tavily to search real-time academic and general knowledge sources.

LLM-Powered Reasoning: Utilizes Groqâ€™s Qwen QWQ-32B for fast and capable natural language understanding and generation.

LangGraph Workflow: Constructs a dynamic flow using StateGraph, adding intelligent branching via ToolNode and tools_condition.

Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): Adds manual control for reviewing and editing AI-generated responses before they're finalized.

Streaming User Interface: Powered by Streamlit, offering a clean and easy-to-use frontend.

Environment-secure: API keys are managed via .env and python-dotenv.

ðŸ“‚ Tech Stack:
